# Network Traffic Monitoring

The Internet is a big and complex network by which is possible to exchange data across the
all world. The time to deliver packets from one end of the world mainly depends from network
status. In particular, the condition of each router along the path traversed by the packets
determine the delay and throughput end­to­end.

The aim of this project is to realize a software to monitor a network status and provides the
information topology, network usage and instaured MPLS tunnels, i.e. subset of network in which
some resources are explicitly reserved within the tunnels themselves.

The network taken in consideration could be an Autonomous System which implements OSPF as routing
protocol.
